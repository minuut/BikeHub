## About

I created this in my off time to get comfortable with Filament.
This is a small business model I now use for testing new Filament features each release.
Two panels are included: an admin panel for company and service point management, and a mechanic panel for asset and schedule management within assigned service points.

**Admin panel preview:**

**Mechanic panel preview: (While logged in as demo mechanic within a servicepoint he belongs to).**

He can only manage his own appointments and schedules within the servicepoint, and he can manage loan assets that belong to the servicepoint, while logged into his panel.
If the mechanic is in multiple servicepoints, he can simply click the servicepoint name on the top left and select a different servicepoint and manage his appointments / schedule in there.

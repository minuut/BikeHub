# BikeHub

## Project Overview

BikeHub is designed for bike repair shops. It boasts user-friendly interfaces tailored for Admins, Mechanics, and Customers. Users can conveniently schedule a time for their bike repairs. Mechanics have control over their schedules and appointments specific to each service point. The mechanic panel supports multi-tenancy, enabling mechanics to work seamlessly across different service points. For instance, if a bike repair shop has 3 service points, multi-tenancy ensures efficient management.

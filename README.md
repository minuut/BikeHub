# BikeHub

## Project Overview

BikeHub is designed for bike repair shops. It boasts user-friendly interfaces tailored for Admins, Mechanics, and Customers. Users can conveniently schedule a time for their bike repairs. Mechanics have control over their schedules and appointments specific to each service point. The mechanic panel supports multi-tenancy, enabling mechanics to work seamlessly across different servicepoints. For instance, if a bike repair shop has 3 servicepoints, multi-tenancy ensures efficient management.

## Current Status

The language used in the application is dutch, I will make it multi-language eventually.
